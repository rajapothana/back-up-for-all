Dropping beats that throb with the sensual menace of classic trip-hop, tracks like \u201cWicked Games\u201d plunge you into the moment where the ecstasy of a decadent night out teeters on the edge of the regretful morning after. The Weeknd's glittering club bangers will pull you onto the floor, and his steamy between-the-sheets ballads will seduce you.

He's scored massive hits with undeniably smooth dance-pop anthems and luscious slow jams, whether he's reviving the slick bounce of \u201880s electro-funk on \u201cI Can't Feel My Face\u201d or flipping the club-ready bump of house music into brooding after-dark soul on \u201cStarboy.\u201d That's just one side of singer/songwriter Abel Tesfaye's sound, though. Dropping beats that throb with the sensual menace of classic trip-hop, tracks like \u201cWicked Games\u201d plunge you into the moment where the ecstasy of a decadent night out teeters on the edge of the regretful morning after. The Weeknd's glittering club bangers will pull you onto the floor, and his steamy between-the-sheets ballads will seduce you.
